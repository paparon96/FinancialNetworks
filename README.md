# Project description
The aim of this project is to explore and compare different methods to estimate the interconnectedness of financial institutions. We do this via estimating networks between the *returns* or *volatilities* of the stocks of these financial institutions.

The different methods that we apply are the following:
* Diebold-Yilmaz variance decomposition
* Neighbourhood Selection
* SPACE
* GLASSO
* Sparse Bayesian networks (or directed acyclical graphs)
